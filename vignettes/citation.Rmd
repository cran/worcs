Comprehensive citation of literature, data, materials, methods, and software
is one of the hallmarks of open science. When using the R-implementation of
WORCS, you will most likely be writing your manuscript in `RMarkdown` format.
This means that you will use Markdown `citekey`s to refer to references, and 
these references will be stored in a separate text file known as a `.bib` file.

To ease this process, we recommend following this procedure for citation:

1. During writing, maintain a plain-text `.bib` file with the BibTeX references
for all citations.
    + You can export a `.bib` file from most reference manager
    programs; the free, open-source reference manager
    [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) is excellent and user-friendly,
    and highly interoperable with other commercial reference managers. [Here](https://christopherjunk.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/25/zotero-RMarkdown/) is a tutorial for using Zotero with RMarkdown.
    + Alternatively, it is possible to make this file by hand, copy and pasting
    each new reference below
    the previous one; e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:scholarbib) shows how to obtain a
    BibTeX reference from Google Scholar; simply copy-paste each reference into
    the `.bib` file
2. To cite a reference, use the `citekey` - the first word in the BibTeX entry
for that reference. Insert it in the RMarkdown file like so: `@yourcitekey2020`.
For a parenthesized reference, use `[@citekeyone2020; @citekeytwo2020]`. For
more options, see the [RMarkdown cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html).
3. To indicate a *non-essential* citation, mark it with a double at-symbol: `@@nonessential2020`.
4. When Knitting the document, adapt the `knit` command in the YAML header.  
  `knit: worcs::cite_all` renders all citations, and  
  `knit: worcs::cite_essential` removes all *non-essential* citations.
5. Optional: To be extremely thorough, you could make a "branch" of the GitHub repository for the print version of the manuscript. Only in this branch, you use the function `knit: worcs::cite_essential`. The procedure is documented in [this tutorial](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/142364_3b344a38149b465c8ebc9a8cd2eee3aa.html).

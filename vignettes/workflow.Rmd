## WORCS: Steps to follow for a project

This vignette describes the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science, as introduced in @vanlissaWORCSWorkflowOpen2020. The paper describes the rationale and principled approach on which the workflow is based; this vignette describes the practical steps for R-users in greater detail.

### Phase 1: Study design

1. <!--S: Create a (Public or Private) remote repository on a 'Git' hosting service-->Create a new remote repository on a 'Git' hosting service, such as ["GitHub"](https://github.com)
    + For inexperienced users, we recommend making this repository "Private", which means only you and selected co-authors can access it. You can set it to "Public" later - for example, when the paper goes to print - and the entire history of the Repository will be public record. We recommend making the repository "Public" from the start __only if__ you are an experienced user and know what you are doing.
    + Copy the repository's `https://` link to clipboard; this link should look something like `https://[...].git`
2. <!--S: When using R, initialize a new RStudio project using the WORCS template. Otherwise, clone the remote repository to your local project folder.-->In Rstudio, click File > New Project > New directory > WORCS Project Template
    a. Paste the remote Repository address in the textbox. This address should look like `https://[...].git`
    b. Keep the checkbox for `renv` checked if you want to use dependency management (recommended)
    c. Select a preregistration template
3. <!--S: Add a README.md file, explaining how users should interact with the project, and a LICENSE to explain users' rights and limit your liability. The `worcs` project template does this automatically.-->Add a README.md file, explaining how users should interact with the project, and a LICENSE to explain users' rights and limit your liability.
3. <!--S: Optional: Preregister your analysis by committing a plain-text preregistration and tagging the commit as "preregistration".-->Preregister your analysis:
    + Document study plans in a `preregistration.Rmd` file, and optionally, planned analyses in a `.R` file.
    + In the top-right panel of 'RStudio', select the 'Git' tab
    + Select the checkbox next to the preregistration file(s)
    + Click the Commit button.
    + In the pop-up window, write an informative "Commit message", e.g., "Preregistration"
    + Click the Commit button below the message dialog
    + Click the green arrow labeled "Push" to send your commit to the 'Git' remote repository
    + Tag this commit as a preregistration on the remote repository. A tagged release helps others retrieve this commit.
    + Instructions for 'GitHub' [are explained here ](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases)
        - Go to the 'GitHub' page for your project
        - Click the label that says "0 releases"
        - Click the button labeled "Create new release"
        - In the textbox labeled "Tag version" and the textbox "Release title", write: "Preregistration"
        - Click the green button labeled "Publish release"
4. <!--S: Optional: Upload the preregistration to a dedicated preregistration server-->Optional: Render the preregistration to PDF, and upload it as an attachment to a dedicated preregistration server like AsPredicted.org or OSF.io
    + In 'RStudio', with the file 'preregistration.Rmd' open, click the "Knit" button above the top left panel
    + When the PDF is generated, go to one of the recognized preregistration services' websites, create a new preregistration, and upload it as an attachment.
5. <!--S: Optional: Add study Materials to the repository-->Optional: Add study Materials to the repository.
    + Only do this for study materials to which you own the rights, or when the materials' license allows it
    + You can solicit feedback and outside contributions on a 'Git' remote repository by opening an "Issue" or by accepting "Pull requests"

### Phase 2: Writing and analysis

6. <!--S: Create an executable script documenting the code required to load the raw data into a tabular format, and de-identify human subjects if applicable-->Create an executable script documenting the code required to load the raw data into a tabular format, and de-identify human subjects if applicable
    + Document this preprocessing ("data wrangling") procedure in the `prepare_data.R` file.
    + This file is intended to document steps that can not or should not be replicated by end users, unless they have access to the raw data file.
    + These are steps you would run only once, the first time you load data into R.
    + Make this file as short as possible; only include steps that are absolutely necessary
7. <!--S: Save the data into a plain-text tabular format like `.csv`. When using open data, commit this file to 'Git'. When using closed data, commit a checksum of the file, and a synthetic copy of the data.-->Save the data using `open_data()` or `closed_data()`
    + <font colour = "red">__WARNING:__ Once you commit a data file to the 'Git' repository, its record will be retained forever (unless the entire repository is deleted). Assume that pushing data to a 'Git' remote repository cannot be undone. Follow the mantra: "Never commit something you do not intend to share".</font>
    + When using external data sources (e.g., obtained using an API), it is recommended to store a local copy, to make the project portable and to ensure that end users have access to the same version of the data you used.
8. <!--S: Write the manuscript using a dynamic document generation format, with code chunks to perform the analyses.-->Write the manuscript in `Manuscript.Rmd`
    + Use code chunks to perform the analyses. The first code chunk should call `load_data()`
    + Finish each sentence with one carriage return (enter); separate paragraphs with a double carriage return.
9. <!--S: Commit every small change to the 'Git' repository-->Regularly Commit your progress to the Git repository; ideally, after completing each small and clearly defined task.
    + In the top-right panel of 'RStudio', select the 'Git' tab
    + Select the checkboxes next to all files whose changes you wish to Commit
    + Click the Commit button.
    + In the pop-up window, write an informative "Commit message".
    + Click the Commit button below the message dialog
    + Click the green arrow labeled "Push" to send your commit to the remote repository
10. <!--S: Cite essential references with `@`, and non-essential references with `@@`-->While writing, cite essential references with one at-symbol, `[@essentialref2020]`, and non-essential references with a double at-symbol, `[@@nonessential2020]`.

### Phase 3: Submission and publication

11. <!--S: Use dependency management to make the computational environment fully reproducible-->Use dependency management to make the computational environment fully reproducible. When using `renv`, you can save the state of the project library (all packages used) by calling `renv::snapshot()`. This updates the lockfile, `renv.lock`.
12. <!--S: Optional: Add a WORCS-badge to your project's README file-->Optional: Add a WORCS-badge to your project's README file and complete the optional elements of the WORCS checklist to qualify for a "Perfect" rating. Run the `check_worcs()` function to see whether your project adheres to the WORCS checklist (see `worcs::checklist`)
    + This adds a WORCS-badge to your 'README.md' file, with a rank of "Fail", "Limited", or "Open".
    + Reference the WORCS checklist and your paper's score in the paper.
    + *Optional:* Complete the additional optional items in the WORCS checklist by hand, and get a "Perfect" rating.
13. <!--S: Make a Private 'Git' remote repository Public-->Make the 'Git' remote repository "Public" if it was set to "Private"
    + Instructions for 'GitHub': 
        - Go to your project's repository
        - Click the "Settings" button
        - Scroll to the bottom of the page; click "Make public", and follow the on-screen instructions
14. <!--S: Optional: [Create a project page on the Open Science Framework](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019737594-Create-a-Project)-->Optional: [Create a project on the Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019737594-Create-a-Project); you may have already done this in Step 4.
15. <!--S: [Connect your 'OSF' project page to the 'Git' remote repository](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019929813-Connect-GitHub-to-a-Project)-->[Connect your 'OSF' project page to the 'Git' remote repository](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019929813-Connect-GitHub-to-a-Project)
16. <!--S: Add an open science statement to the Abstract or Author notes, which links to the 'Git' remote repository or 'OSF' page-->Add an open science statement to the Abstract or Author notes, which links to the 'Git' remote repository or 'OSF' page. 
    + Placing this statement in the Abstract or Author note means that readers can find your project even if the paper is published behind a paywall.
    + The link can be masked for blind review.
    + The open science statement should indicate which resources are available in the online repository; data, code, materials, study design details, a pre-registration, and/or comprehensive citations. For further guidance, see @aalbersbergMakingScienceTransparent2018. Example:  
    _In the spirit of open science, an online repository is available at XXX,
    which contains [the data/a synthetic data file], analysis code, the research
    materials used, details about the study design, more comprehensive citations,
    and a tagged release with the preregistration._
17. <!--S: Render the dynamic document to PDF-->Knit the paper to PDF for submission
    + In 'RStudio', with the file 'manuscript.Rmd' open, click the "Knit" button above the top left panel
    + To retain essential citations only, change the front matter of the 'manuscript.Rmd' file:  
    Change `knit: worcs::cite_all` to `knit: worcs::cite_essential`
18. <!--S: Optional: [Publish the PDF as a preprint, and add it to the OSF project](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930533-Upload-a-Preprint)-->Optional: [Publish preprint in a not-for-profit preprint repository such as PsyArchiv, and connect it to your existing OSF project](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930533-Upload-a-Preprint)
    + Check [Sherpa Romeo](http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) to be sure that your intended outlet allows the publication of preprints; many journals do, nowadays - and if they do not, it is worth considering other outlets.
19. <!--S: Submit the paper, and tag the release of the submitted paper, as in Step 3.-->Submit the paper, and tag the release of the submitted paper as in Step 3.

### Notes for cautious researchers

<!--S: Some researchers might want to share their work only once the paper is accepted for publication. In this case, we recommend creating a "Private" repository in Step 1, and completing Steps 13-18 upon acceptance.-->Some researchers might want to share their work only once the paper is accepted for publication. In this case, we recommend creating a "Private" repository in Step 1, and completing Steps 13-18 upon acceptance by the journal.

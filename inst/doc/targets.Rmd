Code in reproducible projects is often executed much more often than in non-reproducible projects.
After each change, the entire analysis is typically executed to check if its results still reproduce.
While such rigorous testing is integral to reproducibility [see 'Using Endpoints to Check Reproducibility'](endpoints.html),
executing unchanged code can be redundant.
Moreover, if the analyses take a long time, this can take the steam out of your sails if you are in the flow, working on a project.
Computing also has an environmental footprint,
and it is worth considering the trade-off between re-running code sufficiently frequently to ensure its reproducibility,
but not needlessly beyond that [@guptaChasingCarbonElusive2021].

The [`targets` package](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) addresses this challenge.
It facilitates defining and executing an analysis pipeline,
and tracks dependencies between blocks of code to ensure that code is only re-run if it has changed, or if its input has changed.
Since version `0.1.15`, `worcs` facilitates the use of `targets` in `worcs` projects.
The `targets` package is perfectly complementary to `worcs`,
and this Vignette describes the two canonical ways of combining the two.
Since `targets` requires a specific way of working though,
please make sure to read the [`targets` manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) before jumping in.

## Defining a Pipeline

The canonical way of using `targets` in `worcs` is to select the "Use Targets" checkbox in the "Create a Project" dialog window.
Subsequently, you would define the analysis pipeline in the `_targets.R` script file.
Running `worcs::reproduce()`, or `targets::tar_make()`, will execute the steps in this script.
The script often makes use of analysis functions defined in the `R/` directory.
Since the `worcs` workflow recommends using dynamic document generation,
the pipeline in the `_targets.R` script will often end with rendering an `Rmarkdown` or `Quarto` document.
When adding `targets` to a `worcs` project, this line is automatically added to the `_targets.R` script.
Results from the analysis pipeline can be loaded into the environment in the `Rmarkdown` document using the `targets::tar_load(result_name)` or `targets::tar_load_everything()` functions.

## Using `targets` Markdown

Alternatively, is is possible to run `targets` entirely from within an `Rmarkdown` file.
To this end, either select the "target_markdown" output format when creating a new `worcs` project,
or select any other output format and manually incorporate the `targets` pipeline, following the [manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/markdown.html).
A word of warning however: combining the interactive execution of code chunks while writing an Rmarkdown file with programmatic execution of a pipeline using `tar_make()` is likely to be more prone to bugs than **only** programmatically executing code.

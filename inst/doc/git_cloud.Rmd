The WORCS paper describes a workflow centered around 'GitHub', but there are several other cloud hosting services that offer similar functionality. This vignette describes the process of connecting a `worcs` project to these other cloud hosting services. If you are missing your preferred cloud hosting service, please submit a pull request with a step-by-step tutorial for that service [here](https://github.com/cjvanlissa/worcs/pulls).

## GitLab

### Setup steps (do this only once)

The 'GitLab' website looks and feels almost identical to 'GitHub'. Steps 4 and 5 of the `setup` vignette can be applied nearly without alterations. To connect `worcs` to 'GitLab', I proceeded as follows:

4. Register on GitLab
    + Go to [gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) and click *Register now*. Choose an "Individual", "Free" plan.
    + Request a [free academic upgrade](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/education/). 
5. Connect 'RStudio' to Git and GitLab (for more support, see [this 'RStudio' article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN), and [this blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/07/rstudio-and-github/))
    a. Open 'RStudio', open the Tools menu, click *Global Options*, and click *Git/SVN*
    b. Verify that *Enable version control interface for RStudio projects* is selected
    c. Verify that *Git executable:* shows the location of git.exe. If it is missing, manually fix the location of the file.
    d. Click *Create RSA Key*. Do not enter a passphrase. Press *Create*. A window with some information will open, which you can close.
    e. Click *View public key*, and copy the entire text to the clipboard.
    f. Close 'RStudio' (it might offer to restart by itself; this is fine)
    g. Go to [gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) 
    h. Click your user icon in the top right of the screen, click *Settings*
    i. On the settings page, click *SSH Keys* in the left sidebar
    j. Copy-paste the public key from your clipboard into the box labeled *Key*.
    k. Click *Add key*.
    l. Open 'RStudio' again (unless it restarted by itself)

### Connect new `worcs` project to 'GitLab'

To create a new project on 'GitLab', go to your account page, and click the *Create a project* tile in the middle of the screen.

* Fill in a *Project name*; do not change anything else. Click the green *Create project* button.
* You will see a page titled *"The repository for this project is empty"*. Under the header *"Create a new repository"*, you can see a web address starting with https, like so:  
    `git clone https://gitlab.com/yourname/yourrepo.git`
* Copy only this address, from `https://` to `.git`.
* Paste this address into the New project dialog window.

## Bitbucket

### Setup steps (do this only once)

The 'Bitbucket' website has cosmetic differences from 'GitHub', but works similarly. Steps 4 and 5 of the `setup` vignette can be applied nearly without alterations. To connect `worcs` to 'Bitbucket', I proceeded as follows:

4. Register on Bitbucket
    + Go to [Bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/) and click *Get started for free*. Follow the steps to create your account. Sign in.
    + Bitbucket has largely automated the process of awarding free academic upgrades. If your email address is not recognized as belonging to an academic institution, fill out the form [here](https://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license). 
5. Connect 'RStudio' to Git and Bitbucket (for more support, see [this 'RStudio' article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN), and [this blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/07/rstudio-and-github/))
    a. Open 'RStudio', open the Tools menu, click *Global Options*, and click *Git/SVN*
    b. Verify that *Enable version control interface for RStudio projects* is selected
    c. Verify that *Git executable:* shows the location of git.exe. If it is missing, manually fix the location of the file.
    d. Click *Create RSA Key*. Do not enter a passphrase. Press *Create*. A window with some information will open, which you can close.
    e. Click *View public key*, and copy the entire text to the clipboard.
    f. Close 'RStudio' (it might offer to restart by itself; this is fine)
    g. Go to [Bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/) 
    h. In the bottom left of the screen, click the circular icon with your initials. Select *Personal settings*
    i. On the settings page, click *SSH Keys* in the left sidebar
    j. Click *Add key*
    k. Copy-paste the public key from your clipboard into the box labeled *Key*, and give it a label. Click the *Add key* button.
    l. Open 'RStudio' again (unless it restarted by itself)

### Connect new `worcs` project to 'Bitbucket'

To create a new project on 'Bitbucket', go to your account page, and click *Create repository* in the middle of the page. These steps differ somewhat from the procedure for 'GitHub':

* Enter a *Project name* and a *Repository name*. The latter will be used to connect your `worcs` project.
* __Important:__ Change the setting *Include a README?* to *No*.
* Click "Create repository"
* When the project page opens, you will see the tagline "Let's put some bits in your bucket". Change the dropdown menu Just below this tagline from *SSH* to *https*. It will show a web address starting with https, like this:  
    `git clone https://cjvanlissa@bitbucket.org/yourname/yourrepo.git`
* Copy only this address, from `https://` to `.git`.
* Paste this address into the New project dialog window.

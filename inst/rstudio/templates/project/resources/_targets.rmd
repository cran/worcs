Target Markdown is a powerful R Markdown interface for reproducible analysis pipelines, and the chapter at https://books.ropensci.org/targets/markdown.html walks through it in detail. This R Markdown report the example from the chapter. Try it out in both interactive and non-interactive modes, either by running the code chunks in different ways or setting the `tar_interactive` chunk option.

# Setup

If you are using old versions of `targets` (<= 0.7.0) and/or `knitr` (<= 1.33), you will need to load the `targets` package in the R Markdown document in order for Target Markdown code chunks to work.

```{r}
library(targets)
```

Near the top of the document, you may also wish to remove the `_targets_r` directory previously written by non-interactive runs of the report. Otherwise, your pipeline may contain superfluous targets.

```{r}
library(targets)
tar_unscript()
```

# Targets

Our first target borrows the `airquality` dataset built into base R.

```{targets raw-data}
tar_target(raw_data, airquality)
```

Our next targets preprocess the data, make a histogram, and fit a model.

```{targets downstream-targets}
list(
  tar_target(data, {raw_data[complete.cases(airquality), ]}),
  tar_target(hist, hist(data$Ozone))
)
```

Set the `tar_simple` chunk option to `TRUE` to define a single target with the command in the code chunk. The chunk below only contains `biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)` in the source, but because `tar_simple` is `TRUE`, it is shorthand for `tar_target(name = fit, command = biglm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data))`. All other arguments to `tar_target()` are set to their default values (configurable with `tar_option_set()`).

```{targets fit, tar_simple = TRUE}
lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp, data)
```

# Pipeline

If you ran all the `{targets}` chunks in non-interactive mode, then your R scripts are set up to run the pipeline.

```{r}
tar_make()
```

# Output

You can retrieve results from the `_targets/` data store using `tar_read()` or `tar_load()`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
tar_read(fit)
```

```{r}
tar_read(hist)
```


At this point, you can go back and run `{targets}` chunks in interactive mode without interfering with the code or data of the non-interactive pipeline.
